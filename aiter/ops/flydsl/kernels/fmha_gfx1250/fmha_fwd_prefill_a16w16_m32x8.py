"""MHA Forward Prefill kernel — ``m32x8`` design, gfx1250 (MI400 / mi450).

A clean FlyDSL kernel written in the high-level layout-algebra style
(tiled copy / tiled MMA + ``SharedAllocator``).

``m32x8`` names the threadgroup shape: **8 waves per threadgroup**, each wave
owning a **32-row** Q span (2 adjacent 16-row WMMA tiles). gfx1250 runs wave32,
so a threadgroup is ``8 * 32 = 256`` threads and ``BLOCK_M = 32 * 8 = 256`` Q
rows. (The leading ``32`` is per-wave Q rows; ``16`` is the WMMA M dimension.)

Layout support — two device kernels over one shared compute core (option B):
  - ``kn_fmha_fwd_prefill_a16w16_m32x8_thd``  — varlen THD, driven by ``cu_seqlens``.
  - ``kn_fmha_fwd_prefill_a16w16_m32x8_bshd`` — batched BSHD, uniform ``seq_len`` scalar
    (no ``cu_seqlens`` tensors → nothing transient to bake into a CUDA graph).
Both resolve their per-workgroup base offsets + sequence bounds, then call the
layout-agnostic ``_core_attention`` helper.

Scope — v1 (this file is intentionally config-agnostic in its name):
  - ``qk_hdim in {128, 192, 256}`` (D_qk), ``v_hdim == 128`` (D_v); ``n_block`` is picked
    by ``pick_n_block`` (128 at qk_hdim 128/192, 64 at 256)
  - dtype: bf16 for Q/K/V/O
  - grouped-query attention (GQA): ``gqa = nheads_q // nheads_k``
  - causal and non-causal

``qk_hdim``, ``v_hdim`` and the dtype are compile-time (build-time) parameters
captured by the builder closure, so they never appear in the file name and can
be generalized later without changing the runtime kernel signatures.

Target: gfx1250, wave32, 8 waves per threadgroup (256 threads).

    The R rows are independent (each owns its S, running m/d, and mask bounds) but share

    sum-tree reductions emit INTERLEAVED (position-major across rows, via
    ``_tree_reduce_multi``) so the backend can dual-issue row0/row1 combines and hide each
    other's cross-lane permlanex16 latency. ``s_list[r]`` is already in log2 units
    (softmax_scale*LOG2E applied in Q or on the QK accumulator), so exp is a plain exp2.

    Layout (from ``_qk_gemm``): ``s_list[r]`` is a list of ``NKV = n_block//WMMA_N`` v8-f32
    accumulators; this lane owns query ``q = warp*16 + l%16`` and, in tile ``kvt``, the kv
    rows ``kvt*16 + (l//16)*8 + [0..8)`` (its half). The peer lane ``l^16`` holds the other
    8-row half of the same q, so the row max/sum reduce locally over (kvt, i) then across
    the ``shuffle_xor(16)`` partner.

    ``kv_swap_delta`` is ``KV_SPLIT_PARITY_ORDER``'s correction: when the wave reads the
    tile's two halves in swapped order, slot ``kvt`` holds physical kv-tile ``kvt ^ (NKV/2)``,
    i.e. its absolute offset moves by +/- ``n_block/2``. A runtime Int32 (0 on even SIMDs),
    folded into two per-body mask bases rather than into the NKV per-slot constants.

    Masking (per element, per row r, sequence-relative ``kv_pos = kv_pos_base + (l//16)*8 +
    kvt*16 + i``; all bounds fx.Int32): ``q_max_list[r]`` masks ``kv_pos > q_max`` (band
    upper edge = ``q_seq + (kv_len-q_len) + window_right``; clamped to ``kv_len-1`` on the
    last tile to fold the tail); ``q_min_list[r]`` masks ``kv_pos < q_min`` (band lower edge
    = ``q_seq + (kv_len-q_len) - window_left``); kv_len (only when q_max is None) masks
    ``kv_pos >= kv_len`` (standalone tail for the non-causal case). A None bound skips it.

    Args: ``s_list``/``m_prev_list``/``d_prev_list``/``q_max_list``/``q_min_list`` are
    length-R lists (R = WMMA_ROW_PER_WAVE); the q_*_list default to all-None. m_prev/d_prev
    are fx.Float32 shared by the l<->l^16 pair.

    Returns 4 length-R lists ``(p, m_new, d_new, corr)`` plus ``rescale_masks`` —

    max, STALE (== m_prev) when that row's ballot did not fire (FAv4 §9.1.1);
    d_new = corr*d_prev + rowsum(p); corr = exp(m_prev - m_new) (== 1 on the stale path).
    ``rescale_masks`` is the R raw ballots (None when deferral is compiled out); the

    V fragment is shuffled once and fed into R independent WMMA chains.

    WMMA convention (gfx1250): D[M=d, N=q] with **A = V^T** (src_a, transpose-loaded
    via ds_load_tr16_b128) and **B = P^T** (src_b, the bf16 softmax output). Contract
    kv in ``nkt = n_block//WMMA_K`` tiles (K=32); produce ``d_tiles = v_hdim//WMMA_M``
    output d-tiles (M axis). Lane ``l`` element ``si`` of tile ``dt`` holds
    O[q = l%16, d = dt*WMMA_M + (l//16)*8 + si] — the OManager16b frag layout.

    ``p_list`` is a length-R list; entry ``qt`` is that q-tile's list of softmax
    kv-tiles (bf16 P^T B-operands). ``o_acc_list`` is either None or a length-R
    list of running O accumulators (each ``d_tiles`` v8-f32, already rescaled by
    ``corr``). Returns ``out_list``: a length-R list of updated O accumulators.

    ``v_emit(j)`` emits the ``j``-th V transpose ds_load of the resident block (see
    ``v_mgr.load_one_to_reg``) in flat ``(dt, kt, half)`` order; ``_ring_drive`` calls it on
    demand so only ``ring`` loads are live at a time instead of all 2*d_tiles*nkt. ``head``
    adopts the NP-deep prefetch the caller issues before softmax, so that latency still hides
    under the softmax VALU. Online accumulation: each tile's PV adds onto the running o_acc.
    Each WMMA operand is a v16 bf16 fragment = two 16-wide halves shuffled: A from V-tiles
